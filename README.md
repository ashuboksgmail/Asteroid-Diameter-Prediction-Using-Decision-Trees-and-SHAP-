- Developed a decision tree regression model to predict asteroid diameters using a dataset of orbital and physical parameters.
- Preprocessed categorical features with ordinal and one-hot encoding, followed by feature scaling for improved model performance.
- Trained and tuned the model with optimized hyperparameters, achieving high accuracy and reduced error.
- Utilized SHAP to interpret model predictions, identifying the most influential features and ensuring transparency in decision-making through visualizations like summary and bar plots.
